I'll create examples of the Fibonacci sequence implemented in 5 different programming languages, each with a slightly different approach.

# Fibonacci Sequence Implementations

## Python - Using Recursion
The Python implementation uses classic recursion, though it's not the most efficient approach:

```python
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)

# Example usage
for i in range(10):
    print(f"F({i}) = {fibonacci_recursive(i)}")
```

## JavaScript - Using Generator Function
This JavaScript version uses a generator function to create an infinite Fibonacci sequence:

```javascript
function* fibonacciGenerator() {
    let prev = 0, curr = 1;
    yield prev;
    yield curr;
    
    while (true) {
        const next = prev + curr;
        yield next;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }
}

// Example usage
const fib = fibonacciGenerator();
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(`F(${i}) = ${fib.next().value}`);
}
```

## Rust - Using Dynamic Programming
The Rust implementation uses an iterative approach with a vector to store previous values:

```rust
fn fibonacci_dynamic(n: usize) -> u64 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n as u64;
    }
    
    let mut fib = vec![0; n + 1];
    fib[1] = 1;
    
    for i in 2..=n {
        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2];
    }
    
    fib[n]
}

fn main() {
    for i in 0..10 {
        println!("F({}) = {}", i, fibonacci_dynamic(i));
    }
}
```

## Go - Using Channels
This Go implementation uses channels to generate Fibonacci numbers concurrently:

```go
func fibonacciChannel(n int, ch chan int) {
    x, y := 0, 1
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        ch <- x
        x, y = y, x+y
    }
    close(ch)
}

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int, 10)
    go fibonacciChannel(10, ch)
    
    i := 0
    for num := range ch {
        fmt.Printf("F(%d) = %d\n", i, num)
        i++
    }
}
```

## Ruby - Using Memoization
The Ruby version uses memoization through a hash to cache previously calculated values:

```ruby
def fibonacci_memoized(n, memo = {})
  return n if n <= 1
  memo[n] ||= fibonacci_memoized(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_memoized(n-2, memo)
end

# Example usage
10.times do |i|
  puts "F(#{i}) = #{fibonacci_memoized(i)}"
end
```

Each implementation showcases different programming paradigms and language features:

1. The Python version demonstrates classic recursion, which is simple but inefficient for larger numbers
2. JavaScript uses generator functions, a modern feature that allows for lazy evaluation of infinite sequences
3. Rust implements a dynamic programming approach using a vector, showing its strong systems programming capabilities
4. Go showcases concurrent programming with channels, a key feature of the language
5. Ruby uses memoization with a hash table to cache results, demonstrating its elegant syntax and functional programming capabilities

Each approach has its trade-offs:
- The recursive solution is elegant but can cause stack overflow for large numbers
- The generator approach is memory-efficient for large sequences
- The dynamic programming approach is fast but uses more memory
- The channel-based approach shows how to handle fibonacci generation concurrently
- The memoized approach balances memory usage and performance

All implementations will produce the same sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
